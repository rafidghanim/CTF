Prizes, description, etc:

In order to inspire even more people to engage with the issue, and to sustainably underpin the objectives of the ECSC, an openECSC competition is additionally planned for 2022.

Unlike the ECSC, which is limited to those 25 and younger, as the "open" in the title signifies this new program enables anyone interested – regardless of age, origin or educational background – to take part, demonstrate their knowledge, and become part of the community. So it's an invitation to ALL the world's cybersecurity enthusiasts!
